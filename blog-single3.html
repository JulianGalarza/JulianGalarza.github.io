                Traveling is my second hobby after climbing. I think there is an incredible opportunity to learn and explore the world. I want to talk about what kind of travel I like, and what I have learned about traveling. I will start with the first time I really traveled, a trip that changed my view about traveling. In 2017, a friend invited me to see the whales in a city called Buena Aventura in Colombia. This place was in the middle of nowhere. He knew about the place because he was studying biology, and in one of his classes the professor taught him about this beach. So, I packed my backpack, created the plan,  bought camping equipment, and booked the tickets. 
                </p>
                <p>
                After we arrived at the Buena Aventura Airport, we started our adventure. To get to the beach we took a boat, hiked for 2 days, and then took another boat. This place, in the middle of nowhere, was incredible. I saw paradise. We had gone to where the San Juan River meets the Pacific Ocean, seeing where the color of the ocean changes. The first impressive thing you see is the massiveness of the trees that you can see, and the beautiful birds and animals. While we were hiking, we met a Wonnan Indian Community and were invited to eat dinner with them. They shared their traditions with us and welcomed us into the community. They taught me that we are not just visitors to the place, but that we are a part of the place. This experience was one of the best of my life. Finally, we explored the ocean to search for these beautiful and huge animals. It was incredible to see a group of 5 whales in the ocean, jumping and playing.  At that moment I understood that there are amazing things to explore and that there are more important things that only work and humans.
                </p>
                <p>
                In conclusion, my kind of travel is adventure travel, ones with a map, animal, hiking, and nature. However, I enjoy getting to know new cities to meet their culture, museums, and architecture. I am a huge fan of architecture and my favorite architect is Santiago Calatrava. Overall, I have learned different things about traveling. The first one is that traveling can change your energy and mood. If you are sad or alone or bored, plan a trip and you will see what this can add to your life. The second is that planning makes a huge difference. Traveling requires different skills and one is planning. I have organized at least 30 different trips. Normally, I call the places, reserve a guide, buy food and organize the other people on the trip. I love traveling so much that I even met my current girlfriend traveling through South America, in Argentina. This is another story, but it can give you the idea of what you can find.  If you have a good destination, please reach out to me! Maybe we can coordinate and explore that place together.
